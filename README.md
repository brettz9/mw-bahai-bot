# mw-bahai-bot

***This is not currently designed as a generic, reusable bot. It is just a
playground for some one-off modifications I hope to make.***

## Development

1. Create or modify account at <https://bahai9.com/wiki/Special:BotPasswords>.
    One must use such a Bot account, not only to show up distinctly in
    `Special:RecentChanges`, but also to even be able to use `login` from the
    API.
1. Add credentials to an ESM file at `credentials.js` at project root. Should
    contain `apiUrl` (URL of `api.php`), `username`, and `password`.

## To-dos

1. Add **[shortcut redirects](https://bahaipedia.org/Shortcuts)** to the wikis

## Possible to-dos

1. Wikibase populating?
